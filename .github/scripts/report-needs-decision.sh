# Decides whether the nightly rebase report asks a human for a decision.
#
# The upstream-rebase skill tells Claude to list anything it was unsure about
# under a "## Needs a decision" section, each item marked UNSURE. A rebase can
# be clean by every mechanical measure (no drift, builds pass) and still raise
# such a question: an upstream change that interacts with a downstream feature
# without touching the same lines. The workflow does not push those
# automatically; it opens a pull request so a maintainer sees the question
# before the branch moves.
#
# The report counts as asking for a decision when either:
#   - its "Needs a decision" section has any content other than "None.", or
#   - any line marks something UNSURE.
# Both err towards a pull request: a stray "UNSURE" costs one review, a missed
# question costs an unreviewed hypervisor change.
#
# Usage:
#   report-needs-decision.sh <report.md>
#
# Prints the section's content when it asks for a decision. Exit status:
#   0  a decision is needed
#   1  no decision is needed
#   2  the report cannot be read
